Skyblock Dupe-Checker Serverwide

What does it do? This mod adds High-Value Dupe checker into your skyblock experience, It also tracks UUID of items and compare them serverwise to make sure the items you buy are 99.99% safe and not duped!

Why is this useful? Many players have been wiped before, now this will prevent it. Don't buy anything before Dupe-Checking it!

(Disclaimer) The mod doesn't work outside of inventories, it is not applicable on auction house, and it is a lot more accurate than mods like Skytils and Skyblock Extras also doesnt work with some mods.

Commands:

/adc on - Activates the dupe checker

/adc off - Deactivates the dupe checker
